#Tasks:

Function: add_numbers (2 points)

Write a Python function named add_numbers that takes two parameters num1 and num2, and returns the sum of the two numbers.
Function: is_even (2 points)

Write a Python function named is_even that takes a single parameter number and returns True if the number is even, and False otherwise.
Function: reverse_string (2 points)

Write a Python function named reverse_string that takes a string text as input and returns the reversed version of that string.
Function: count_vowels (2 points)

Write a Python function named count_vowels that takes a string text as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. Ignore case sensitivity.
Function: calculate_factorial (2 points)

Write a Python function named calculate_factorial that takes a non-negative integer n as input and returns the factorial of that number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
Function: apply_decorator (1 point)

Write a Python function named apply_decorator that takes a function func as input and applies a decorator named decorator_func. The decorator should simply print "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.
Sequences: Sort List of Tuples (1 point)

Given a list of tuples where each tuple contains a name and an age, write a Python function named sort_by_age that sorts the list of tuples by age in ascending order.
Sets and Dictionaries: Merge Dictionaries (1 point)

Write a Python function named merge_dicts that takes two dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary. If there are any common keys, their values should be summed up.
Object-Oriented Programming: Class Creation (2 points)

Define a Python class named Car with the following attributes: make, model, year. Implement a method named display_info that prints out the car's information.
